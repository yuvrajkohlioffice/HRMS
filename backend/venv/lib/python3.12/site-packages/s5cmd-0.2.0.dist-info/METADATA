## Overview

`s5cmd` is a very fast S3 and local filesystem execution tool. It comes with
support for a multitude of operations including tab completion and wildcard
support for files, which can be very handy for your object storage workflow
while working with large number of files.

This project provides the infrastructure for building the `s5cmd` Python wheels.
For more information about `s5cmd`, please refer to
https://github.com/peak/s5cmd.

The Python wheels provided here contain the official `s5cmd` executable, which
is sourced from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/releases).
Once the wheel is installed, a convenient launcher executable is automatically
placed in the PATH. This launcher is created during installation by pip,
leveraging the `[project.scripts]` configuration defined in the `pyproject.toml`
file.

## Platforms

The following platforms are supported by the binary wheels:

| OS            | Arch                                                                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows       | 64-bit<br>32-bit<br>ARM64                                                    |
| Linux Intel   | manylinux 64-bit<br>musllinux 64-bit<br>manylinux 32-bit<br>musllinux 32-bit |
